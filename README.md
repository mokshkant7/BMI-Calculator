# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª 

Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

### Requirements :
You will need Flutter along with Android Studio or VS Code.

For installing Android Studio (I personally use Android Studio): 
https://developer.android.com/studio

For installing Flutter SDK:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor

Once both of these are setup, you're good to go. Just run the project.
Cheers !
